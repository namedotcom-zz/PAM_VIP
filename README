Description:
PAM_VIP is a Pluggable Authentication Module for use in the AUTH layer of a PAM stack. This
module imposes a further restriction on authenticating users by requiring valid two-factor
authentication with Verisign's VIP service.

Use:
In order to require two-factor authentication, add this module to the appropriate position
in the desired service's module stack in "/etc/pam.d/". If debugging output is desired, you must
specify "debug" immediately after the module name in the service's pam.d stack file. Once debugging
is enabled, debug messages are written to "/tmp/sshd.log", unless this path ahs been changed in the source
Credentials should be entered in the form: <username>, <password::viptoken>. That is, your password and VIP
OTP (one-time-password) should be concatenated together and input as the user's password. After the
module has run, the user's password (without the OTP) has been set as the value of PAM_AUTHTOK for
use by other auth modules.

Configuration:
System-specific variables should be set in vip_pam.conf (see provided example), and are 
labelled accordingly. This file should be located at /etc/vip_pam.conf, or the path must
be adjusted in the source.

Requirements:
pam_vip requires the following be installed on your machine:
-openldap
-libxml2
-curl
-libconfuse
-linux-PAM, obviously
